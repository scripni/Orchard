ResourceManager Notes from Bertrand
====================================

x No default parameters
x Refactor to take over resource manager name
Better interface pattern for defining resources
Script.Load API that is a view engine specific helper and that directs rendering within the using (using Idisposable pattern) to a buffer that can be rendered later.
x Script.Require returns RequireSettings and has fluent api to add stuff later.
When using the shortcut registration+require Script.Require("../script/foo.js") we resolve the url to an app-relative path and use that as the id.
If you want ot define a debug version in that case, just do a proper registration.
To decide if the app is in debug mode, we look at a setting on the require, then at site setting mode and as a last resort on the compilation mode of the app.
Merge asap, then debug, then refactor.

Raw notes from Dave during meeting:
====================================
	Script.RequireHead("TinyMce");
	Script.RequireFoot("TinyMce", new RequireSettings { DebugMode = false });

	Script.Require("Foo", "1.4.2", d => {
		d.SetUrl("dfdf")
	});

	Script.Require("~/modules/mymodule/scripts/foo.min?.js")
	Script.Require("/orchardlocal/dfdfd/foo.js")

// x no defualt params
// better interface/pattern for defining resources
// Script.Load (view-engine specific helper required)
// x Script.Require returns RequireSettings and has fluent api?
// x (no) Add Script.RequireHead <-- or no due to fluent api
// x Rename Localization resource manager
// Require w/ app relative url means inline definitin of url only, resolved url is resource name
// Site setting for debug mode true false or from web.config setting
// Moved all copies of jquery and jquery related scripts to a single location
// Get minified versions of any external scripts that we don't currently have.
// Integrate MS ajax min to build to minify our own js and css files?


	//using(Script.InlineTailScriptAfterEverythingElseOnThePageWithoutLambda()) {
	//}
